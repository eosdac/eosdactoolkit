# eosdactoolkit

## Purpose
The DAC toolkit for building and running DACs. This is the member client where the DAC members will interface with the deployed smart contract code. The code is written in javascript using Vue.js and Quasar-framework.js.

## Pre-Requisites
You want to be able to read javascript code and have a basic understanding of frontend web development. If you want to simply change the assets to your DAC's messaging, branding, and images then the process is not too difficult. The details are in `eosdac-material/README.md`
